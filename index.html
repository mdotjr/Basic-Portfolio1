    <p>One thing I can really say about myself is that I really, really LOVE          PIZZA! I think it's best to get the most important fact about myself out   the way first. Pepperoni is by far my favorite. Now, to the serious talk. I am born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri. I was fortunate enough to be pretty good in basketball where I earned myself an athletic scholarship. I graduated from Park University located in Kansas City, Missouri. 
        I have now been out of undergrad for 2 1/2 years now. Currently I work at Enterprise Rent-A-Car.</p>
    <p>I also run my own business. I am CEO of my clothing line called Fly Li≈çn (Lee Own) The Brand. I have been running this for exactly one year. I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp at SMU.</p>
